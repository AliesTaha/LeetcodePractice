235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA)
of two given nodes in the BST.
Example 1:
        _______6______
       /              \
    ___2__          ___8__
   /      \        /      \
   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

Example 2:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:
Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between
two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants
(where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”


For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a
descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

What is Binary Search Tree?
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
